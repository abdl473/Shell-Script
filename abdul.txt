Clarifications :
----------------
-> Impala HUE UI
-> Password check from CM

-> SaveNameSpace location
-> Hive config para set from Hue
-> Differen btwn hive & impala
-> Pig examples
-> SLA
-> Oozie demo
-> Metastore access to other users
-> Backup Hadoop service Databases
-> Linux admin commands

-> .bashrc, host.exclude, 
-> set environmental path ( java alternatives)
